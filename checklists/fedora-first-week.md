# Fedora First-Week Checklist

Goal: establish a secure, stable baseline before installing a lot of tools.

## Security baseline
- [ ] Enable full-disk encryption (LUKS) during install
- [ ] Confirm Secure Boot is enabled (if supported)
- [ ] Apply all system updates
- [ ] Confirm firewall is enabled
- [ ] Confirm SELinux is enforcing

## Core tools (minimal)
- [ ] Install a browser (Firefox recommended)
- [ ] Install a password manager (Bitwarden or KeePassXC)
- [ ] Install a notes system (Obsidian or Logseq)

## Foundations for sovereignty
- [ ] Decide your primary data locations (local + sync + backup)
- [ ] Create your first backup, even if manual
- [ ] Document your initial choices in /progress (what you chose and why)
