# Data Sovereignty Playbook (Linux-First, NIST-Aligned)

A practical playbook for individuals (and small teams) who want to reduce reliance on centralized platforms and move toward a more local-first, portable, and governed digital life—without turning it into a fragile hobby.

This repository applies **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0** concepts at a personal scale: governance, protect/detect/recover discipline, and explicit tradeoffs.

## What “data sovereignty” means here
Data sovereignty in this repo is not a purity test. It means:
- You understand where your data lives
- You can move it (portability)
- You can restore it (resilience)
- You control the keys, access, and lifecycle
- Convenience is a conscious choice, not a default

## How to use this repo
- Start with `/docs/00-overview.md`
- Use `/checklists/` for runnable steps
- Read `/decisions/` for “why we chose this” (ADRs)
- Follow `/progress/` for implementation notes and lessons learned

## Structure
- `docs/` — canonical playbook sections (publication-quality)
- `checklists/` — operational runbooks you can execute
- `decisions/` — Architecture Decision Records (ADR) for major choices
- `progress/` — monthly “field notes” and iteration log
- `templates/` — consistent documentation templates for updates/experiments
