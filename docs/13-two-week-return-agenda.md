# Two-Week Return Agenda

This agenda is used when returning to this project after time away.

---

## Day 1 — Reorientation (60–90 minutes)
- Read README
- Re-read `/docs/12-repo-management-playbook.md`
- Skim latest `/progress/YYYY/YYYY-MM.md`
- Review open GitHub Issues

Outcome: mental context restored.

---

## Day 2–3 — One focused experiment
- Pick **one** experiment issue
- Create branch: `experiment/<topic>`
- Run experiment
- Document results
- Update progress log

Outcome: learning captured, not lost.

---

## Day 4 — Synthesis
- Decide:
  - Document as guidance?
  - Record as ADR?
  - Abandon?
- Update `/docs` or `/decisions` accordingly

Outcome: learning promoted to doctrine (or explicitly rejected).

---

## Day 5 — Cleanup
- Open PR
- Merge with merge commit
- Delete branch
- Update CHANGELOG if needed

Outcome: repo returns to a clean, stable state.

---

## Rule of thumb
One experiment per cycle.
Clarity beats speed.
