# Principles & Guardrails

These principles govern all decisions in this playbook.

## Core principles
- Local-first by default
- Federation over centralization
- Explicit trust boundaries
- Encryption is non-negotiable
- Portability over convenience
- Sustainability over novelty

## Guardrails
- Avoid social login coupling
- Maintain at least 2 backups (1 offsite, 1 encrypted)
- Self-host only what can be patched, backed up, and restored
- Prefer boring, well-documented tools
