# Overview

This playbook defines a **personal data sovereignty operating model** using a Linux-first approach and enterprise governance concepts adapted from **NIST CSF 2.0**.

## Objectives
- Reduce reliance on centralized platforms
- Increase data portability and recoverability
- Make tradeoffs explicit and reversible
- Enable learning through safe experimentation

## What this is not
- A rejection of modern tools or AI
- A mandate to self-host everything
- A hobbyist homelab guide

This is about **intentional system design**, applied at a personal scale.
