# NIST Mapping

This playbook uses **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0** as a conceptual anchor.

## How NIST is used here
- As a decision framework, not compliance
- To keep tradeoffs explicit
- To emphasize governance, resilience, and recovery

## High-level mapping
- Governance & principles → CSF Govern (GV)
- Identity & access → CSF Protect (PR.AA)
- Data security & lifecycle → CSF Protect (PR.DS)
- Monitoring & hygiene → CSF Detect (DE)
- Backup & restore → CSF Recover (RC)
